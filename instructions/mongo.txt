In the next few lectures you will learn about an Object Document Modeling (ODM) package for Express called Mongoose.

You may run into a warning in your terminal regarding the deprecation of mpromise, it will look like this:

Mongoose: mpromise (mongoose's default promise library) is deprecated, plug in your own promise library
instead: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html
We don't use promises in this course, so that warning can be safely ignored.

If you want the warning to go away then you can plug the following line of code into your app, after you've required mongoose: 

mongoose.Promise = global.Promise; 

That line of code simply replaces Mongoose's default promise library with JavaScript's native promise library.

Update: Another warning that you may experience when using mongoose is this:

`open()` is deprecated in mongoose >= 4.11.0, use `openUri()` instead, 
or set the `useMongoClient` option if using `connect()` or `createConnection()`
To make this go away simply use:

mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/yelp_camp", {useMongoClient: true});

instead of the regular mongoose.connect() syntax.
